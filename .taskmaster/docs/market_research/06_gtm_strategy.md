## Sales Model: Land-and-Expand Sidecar

### Phase 1: Land (Collections OS Sidecar)
**Goal:** Low-friction entry with 30-day pilot proving ROI before commitment

**Process:**
1. **Discovery Call (15-30 min):**
   - Qualify fit (50-500 units, uses AppFolio/Yardi/Buildium, late rent pain)
   - Understand current pain (on-time rate, staff time, bad debt)
   - Set expectations for pilot (what we need, what they get)

2. **Demo (30-45 min):**
   - Show product walkthrough (manager dashboard, resident portal, playbook setup)
   - Highlight compliance features (TCPA, FDCPA, Fair Housing)
   - Present case study or pilot results (if available)
   - Address objections

3. **Pilot Proposal (1 week decision):**
   - 30-day pilot, 1-2 properties (100-200 units)
   - $0 upfront, pay only if measurable improvement
   - Success criteria: 10-15% on-time rent improvement
   - White-glove setup (we do the work)

4. **Pilot Execution (30 days):**
   - Week 1: Setup and baseline measurement
   - Weeks 2-4: Active collections automation
   - End of Month: Results review and conversion decision

5. **Conversion to Paid:**
   - If results meet expectations (10-15%+ improvement) → Convert to paid subscription
   - Pricing based on unit count (see Unit Economics PRD)
   - Annual or month-to-month contract

### Phase 2: Expand (Add Modules)
**Goal:** Increase account value over time by solving additional pain points

**Timeline:**
- **Month 3-6:** Upsell maintenance module (+$0.25/unit/month)
- **Month 6-12:** Add lease revenue tools (+$0.25/unit/month)
- **Year 2:** Premium support, additional properties

**Target:** 105-110% net revenue retention (NRR) by Year 2

### Phase 3: Migrate (Full Platform, Optional)
**Goal:** Customer-initiated migration to full PMS (long-term, not pushed)

**When:**
- Customer has adopted all modules (collections, maintenance, lease management)
- Frustrated with current PMS limitations
- Sees value in consolidated platform
- Only after proven value across all modules
