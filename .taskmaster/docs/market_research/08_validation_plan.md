# PRD: 6-Week Validation Plan
## Collections OS - Market & Product Validation

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Ready to Execute
**Owner:** Founding Team
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Overview

Execute focused 6-week validation plan to prove that: (1) collections pain is acute enough to drive buying behavior, (2) 30-day pilot can demonstrate measurable ROI, (3) pricing is acceptable for target segment, and (4) product concept resonates with decision-makers.

## Strategic Context

- **Validation Philosophy:** Learn fast, fail fast, pivot if needed
- **Investment:** <$10K in costs (time is main investment)
- **Decision Gate:** If ≥2 of 3 pilots convert to paid → proceed to launch
- **Output:** Customer insights, validated messaging, proven ROI, 2-3 paying customers

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Week 1-2 Goals: Customer Discovery
- [ ] Conduct 20 customer discovery interviews
- [ ] Quantify pain points with hard numbers (on-time rate, staff hours, DSO)
- [ ] Validate willingness to pay at proposed pricing
- [ ] Identify 3-5 pilot candidates

### Week 3-4 Goals: Pilot Offer & MVP Build
- [ ] Finalize pilot offer (validated with 10+ customers)
- [ ] Build functional MVP (CSV import, Plaid, Twilio, simple dashboard)
- [ ] Recruit 3 pilot customers and get commitment
- [ ] Capture baseline metrics for each pilot

### Week 5-6 Goals: Pilot Execution
- [ ] Execute 30-day pilots with 3 customers
- [ ] Demonstrate 10-15% on-time rent improvement

- ✅ **Pain quantified:** On-time rate <75%, staff time >15 hours/week, willingness to pay ≥$500/month
- ✅ **3 pilots recruited** (signed pilot agreements)
- ✅ **≥2 pilots convert to paid** (66%+ conversion rate)
- ✅ **Measurable ROI proven:** 10-15% on-time improvement, 5-10 hours saved
- ✅ **Zero compliance issues:** No TCPA/FDCPA complaints

### Failure Criteria (Pivot or Stop Signal)
- ❌ <2 pilots convert to paid (<66% conversion)
- ❌ <10% on-time rent improvement (insufficient value)
- ❌ Compliance violations (TCPA/FDCPA complaints)
- ❌ Customers say pricing too high (>50% reject)

**Outreach Template (Cold Email):**
```
Subject: Quick question about late rent at [Property Name]

Hi [Name],

I noticed you manage [Property Name] in [City]—congrats on [recent achievement/news if applicable].

I'm building a tool to help property managers reduce late rent without pestering tenants (or burning out staff). Before I go too far down the road, I'd love 20 minutes to understand your current collections process.

Would you be open to a quick call this week? Happy to share what we're working on if it's relevant.

Best,
[Your Name]
[LinkedIn Profile Link]
```

### Interview Question Framework

**Setup (2 minutes):**
> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm building a tool to help property managers reduce late rent without burning out staff or pestering tenants. Before I go too far, I want to make sure I'm solving a real problem. I have about 20 questions—should take 20-30 minutes. Sound good?"

1. **Walk me through what happens when rent is late on the 6th of the month.** Who does what?
   - *Goal: Understand current manual process*

   - *Goal: Quantify on-time rate baseline*

3. **How many hours per week does your team spend on collections follow-up (calls, texts, emails)?**
   - *Goal: Quantify staff time burden*

4. **What tools/systems do you currently use for collections reminders?**
   - *Goal: Understand current tech stack*

#### Pain Quantification (5 minutes)

5. **What's your current Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) for rent collection?**
   - *Goal: Measure cash flow impact*

   - *Goal: Validate ROI framing*

#### Solution Validation (7 minutes)

8. **What would make you try a new collections tool without switching your entire PMS?**
   - *Goal: Validate sidecar approach*

9. **What risks or concerns would stop you from piloting something like this?**
   - *Goal: Identify objections*

10. **If we could prove 15% improvement in 30 days, would you pay $[X]/month?** (Test pricing sensitivity)
    - *Goal: Validate pricing*

#### Buying Process (3 minutes)

11. **Who else would need to be involved in this decision?** (Owner, CFO, compliance officer?)
    - *Goal: Identify economic buyer and influencers*

#### Close & Pilot Recruitment (3 minutes)

18. **Based on what we've discussed, would you be interested in a 30-day pilot with 1-2 of your properties?**
    - *Goal: Gauge pilot interest*

**Closing:**
> "This has been super helpful. Last question: based on what we discussed, if I could prove a 15% improvement in on-time rent within 30 days with a no-cost pilot, would you be interested in testing it with 1-2 properties? No obligation, just a test."

#### Day 31: Results Review

**Measurement Framework:**

| Metric | Baseline (Day 1-7) | Pilot (Day 8-30) | Improvement | Target |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|--------|
| **On-Time Rate (1st-5th)** | 72% | 85% | +13 percentage points | ≥10% |
| **Days Sales Outstanding** | 12 days | 8 days | -4 days | ≥3 days |
| **Staff Hours/Week** | 15 hours | 8 hours | -7 hours | ≥5 hours |

```

### Conversion Decision (End of Week 6)

**Decision Framework:**

**✅ CONVERT TO PAID if:**
- On-time rate improved by ≥10%
- Staff time saved ≥5 hours/week
- Zero compliance complaints
- Customer satisfied (NPS ≥7)

**🤔 EXTEND PILOT if:**
- Results close but not quite there (8-9% improvement)
- Customer wants to see another month
- Technical issues that need resolution

**❌ END PILOT if:**
- <8% on-time improvement (insufficient value)
- Compliance issues (TCPA/FDCPA complaints)
- Customer dissatisfied or not engaged

### Deliverables (Week 6 End)
- [ ] 3 completed pilots with documented results
- [ ] ≥2 customers converted to paid subscriptions (66%+ conversion)
- [ ] 1-2 case studies (with customer permission)
- [ ] Customer testimonials
- [ ] Lessons learned document (what worked, what didn't)

---

## Post-Validation: Decision Point

### If Validation Succeeds (≥2 pilots convert to paid):

**✅ Proceed to Launch**
- Build out Phase 1 product (full Collections OS)
- Hire Sales Rep #1 to scale customer acquisition
- Consider fundraising (pre-seed $500K-$1M based on traction)

**Next Steps:**
1. Scale pilots to 10-15 customers (Month 7-9)
2. Refine product based on customer feedback
3. Build sales and marketing engine (see GTM PRD)
4. Hire founding team (engineer, sales rep, customer success)

### If Validation Fails (<2 pilots convert):

**🔍 Deep-Dive Analysis**
- Why didn't pilots convert? (pricing, product, results, trust?)
- What would it take to convert them?
- Is the wedge right (collections) or should we pivot (maintenance)?
- Is the ICP right (50-500 units multifamily) or should we adjust?

**Options:**
1. **Iterate & Re-Test:** Fix identified issues, run 3 more pilots
2. **Pivot Wedge:** Try maintenance as entry point instead of collections
3. **Pivot Segment:** Target different customer segment (e.g., SFR, student housing)
4. **Abandon:** Insufficient market pull, move to different opportunity

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Customer recruitment (warm network + cold outreach)
- Pilot customer commitment (signed agreements)
- Bank access (Plaid OAuth approval)
- Messaging platform approvals (Twilio, SendGrid accounts)

### Internal Dependencies
- Engineering resources for MVP build (80-120 hours)
- Founder time for interviews and pilot execution (full-time for 6 weeks)
- Budget for tools and services ($2-5K)

---

## Budget

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Development Tools** | $500 | Heroku, dev tools, APIs |
| **Messaging Credits** | $500 | Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (email) |
| **Payment Processing** | $200 | Plaid, Stripe (if testing payments) |
| **Software Subscriptions** | $300 | Project management, CRM, analytics |
| **Incentives** | $500 | Gift cards for interview participants |
| **Legal** | $1,000 | Pilot agreement review, compliance counsel |
| **Misc** | $500 | Contingency |
| **Total** | **$3,500** | <$10K validation investment |

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Can't Recruit 3 Pilot Customers
- **Mitigation:** Start recruiting in Week 1, leverage warm network first, offer more value (longer pilot, free months)

### Risk 2: MVP Build Takes Longer Than 2 Weeks
- **Mitigation:** Reduce scope ruthlessly, use no-code tools (Retool, Airtable) if needed, hire contract dev

### Risk 3: Pilots Don't Show Measurable Results
- **Mitigation:** Set realistic expectations, choose properties with higher late rates (more room for improvement)

### Risk 4: Compliance Issues During Pilot
- **Mitigation:** Legal review of all templates, TCPA consent workflow, conservative messaging

---
