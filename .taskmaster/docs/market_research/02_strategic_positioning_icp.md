## Property Management SaaS - Collections OS

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Research Phase
**Owner:** Strategy & Product Team
**Last Updated:** November 2025

## Overview

Define clear strategic positioning for Collections OS and develop detailed Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for the beachhead market. This PRD establishes how we position against competitors and who our best-fit customers are.

## Strategic Context

- **Market Position:** Sidecar collections automation vs. full-suite PMS replacement
- **Core Value Prop:** "Reduce late rent by 15%, free up 10+ hours/week—without switching PMS"
- **Differentiation:** Compliance-first, behavioral intelligence, low switching friction

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Establish clear positioning** that differentiates from incumbents
2. **Define ICP with precision** (firmographics, psychographics, behaviors)
3. **Validate messaging** with target customers
4. **Create positioning assets** for sales and marketing

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Positioning statement validated with ≥10 target customers
- [ ] ICP definition with ≥15 qualifying criteria
- [ ] Messaging framework tested and refined
- [ ] Value proposition quantified with ROI model
- [ ] ≥70% of interviewed customers agree positioning resonates

## Key Research Questions

### Positioning
1. What makes us fundamentally different from AppFolio/Yardi/Buildium collections?
2. Why would a customer choose us over adding collections features to existing PMS?
3. What outcomes matter most to decision-makers vs. end users?
4. What objections prevent adoption and how do we address them?
5. How do we position AI without falling into the "AI-first trap"?

### ICP Definition
6. What company characteristics predict successful adoption?
7. What buyer personas are involved in the decision?
8. What pain points are most acute for our ICP?
9. What budget authority and decision process does our ICP have?
10. What existing technology stack does our ICP use?

### Messaging
11. What language resonates most with property managers?
12. How should we frame compliance (feature vs. benefit)?
13. What proof points are most credible (case studies, metrics, testimonials)?
14. What channels do our ICP use for information gathering?

- [ ] Draft initial positioning statement (3 variations)
- [ ] Create ICP criteria checklist

### Week 3-4: Validation & Refinement
- [ ] Test positioning variations with 10 target customers
- [ ] Validate ICP criteria against 20 interviewed companies
- [ ] Refine messaging based on resonance testing
- [ ] Create buyer persona profiles from interview data
- [ ] Document objection handling framework

### Week 5-6: Asset Creation

- Go-to-market strategy (to align messaging by channel)

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Research and initial drafting
- **Week 3-4:** Validation and refinement
- **Week 5-6:** Asset creation and finalization

**Total Duration:** 6 weeks (parallel with Market Landscape PRD)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Deliverables

- ICP definition with ≥15 qualifying criteria
- 3 buyer persona profiles
- Messaging framework with objection handling

### Stretch Goals
- Quantified value proposition with ROI calculator
- Channel-specific messaging variations (5+ channels)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Positioning Too Narrow (Miss Opportunities)
- **Mitigation:** Define beachhead clearly but document adjacent opportunities for Phase 2-3

### Risk 2: Positioning Too Broad (No Differentiation)
- **Mitigation:** Focus on collections wedge, resist urge to be "full-suite PMS"

### Risk 3: Messaging Doesn't Resonate
- **Mitigation:** Test early with real customers, iterate based on feedback, use their language

### Risk 4: ICP Too Restrictive (Can't Find Enough Customers)
- **Mitigation:** Define "ideal" vs. "acceptable" fit criteria, prioritize but don't exclude

## Next Steps

1. **Complete customer discovery interviews** (prerequisite)
2. **Draft 3 positioning statement variations** for testing
3. **Build ICP scoring rubric** to evaluate companies
4. **Schedule messaging validation calls** with 10 target customers

## Appendix: Positioning Testing Framework

### Positioning Variation Testing (Week 3-4)

**Variation A: Outcome-First**
> "Increase on-time rent by 15% in 30 days—without switching your PMS. Collections OS uses behavioral science and TCPA-compliant automation to reduce late payments and free up 10+ hours per week."

**Variation B: Problem-First**
> "Stop chasing late rent payments. Collections OS automates collections follow-up with TCPA-compliant reminders, so your team can focus on growing your portfolio, not chasing payments."

**Variation C: Risk-Reduction**
> "Collections automation without the risk. Pilot Collections OS for 30 days with zero upfront cost—prove 15%+ improvement in on-time rent or walk away. Works alongside AppFolio, Yardi, and Buildium."

**Testing Questions:**
1. Which statement is most compelling? (rank 1-3)
2. What specifically resonates?
3. What's confusing or unclear?
4. Would this make you want to learn more? (yes/no)
5. How would you describe this to a colleague?
