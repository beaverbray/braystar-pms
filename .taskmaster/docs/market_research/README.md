## Task Master Integration

### Parsing PRDs into Tasks

Each PRD can be parsed using Task Master to generate actionable tasks:

```bash
# Parse individual PRDs
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/market_research/01_market_landscape_analysis.md --append

# Or parse all at once
for file in .taskmaster/docs/market_research/*.md; do
  task-master parse-prd "$file" --append
done
```

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with validation plan (PRD 08) - most time-sensitive
2. Add market research (PRD 01, 02, 03) - parallel workstreams
3. Add product and compliance (PRD 04, 05) - as validation succeeds
4. Add GTM and pricing (PRD 06, 07) - prepare for scale

### Task Tagging Strategy

Use Task Master tags to organize by workstream:

- `market_research` - PRDs 01, 02, 03
- `compliance` - PRD 04
- `product` - PRD 05
- `gtm` - PRD 06
- `finance` - PRD 07
- `validation` - PRD 08
- `risk` - PRD 09
- `ai_data` - PRD 10

Example:
```bash
task-master add-tag --name market_research --description "Market research and competitive intelligence"
task-master use-tag market_research
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/market_research/01_market_landscape_analysis.md
```
